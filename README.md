# BIS15W2021_ctannous
## Winter Quarter 2021 BIS015L
My name is Chloe, and I am a third year biochemistry and molecular biology student taking BIS015L this quarter. I am so excited to take this class, and am really hoping by the end of this class I feel confident in my own R skills. This repository will be used to document my projects, and progress throughout the quarter
